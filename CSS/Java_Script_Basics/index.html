        <h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>
        <span>JavaScript is a cross-platform. object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extemely popular for a variety of reasons. it is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions, JavaScript lives inside a bost environment(a web browser or Node sever), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</span>

        <ul>
            <li> <span class="green">Variables Declaraction</span> JavaScript Variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript Variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="blue">var x;</span></li>
            <li> <span class="green">Variables Assigment</span> Assigment operators assign values to JavaScript Variables - pur cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = Assigment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="blue"> var x = 10</span>.</li>
            <li> <span class="green">Data Types</span> Data Types are and important concept; to be able to operate on variables you nedd to know the data type, There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean <span class="blue">- true</span> or <span class="blue">false</span>; null - <span class="blue">nu;;</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="pblue">42</span> or <span class="pblue">3.14159</span>; String - <span class="pblue">"Coding Dojo Rocks"</span> Array - <span class="blue">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo']</span>; and Object - <span class="blue">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></li>
            <li><span class="green">Conditionals</span> Whou cn use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="blue">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our block; <span class="blue">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false;<span class="blue">else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
            <li><span class="green">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. thats a loop!</li>
            <li><span class="green">Function</span> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the tble the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do lets call our function over and over and over and again.</li>
